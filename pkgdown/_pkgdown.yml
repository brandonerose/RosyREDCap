  - title: Core Pipeline Functions (Basic)
    desc: For basic users use these core functions to maintain REDCap data pipelines. Setup or Load your project. Update from REDCap using what is already saved. Save the outputs to a directory.

  - title: Everything by Topic (Intermediate/Advanced)
    desc: Expands on functionality and breaksdown core feautures into more customizable parts
  - subtitle: Project Cache
    desc: RosyREDCap cahces user-level project metadata (name, directory, links, last update and other details). Tokens and data are NOT stored here.

      - cache_clear
      - cache_path
      - check_folder_for_projects
      - project_health_check
  - subtitle: Tokens
    desc: Tokens are required to use the REDCap API. Never share your tokens.
    contents:
      - set_REDCap_token
      - view_REDCap_token
      - test_REDCap_token
  - subtitle: Setup/Load/Save/Delete DB Object
    desc: DB objects are R lists meant to store all metadata and data for a single REDCap project. They utilize the REDCap log to only fetch recent updates. The can be "mirrored" to a local/cloud directory to maintain file pipelines and/or used for an exploratory data analysis shiny app via `run_RosyREDCap`.

      - delete_DB
      - save_DB
  - subtitle: Get from REDCap
    desc: For most project, even with tens-of-thousands records and hundreds of variables, this can be handeled with update_DB. This package is not presently intended for massive REDCap projects.
    contents:

  - subtitle: Upload to and Delete from REDCap
    desc: Always use with caution! Package takes several steps to test and confirm uploads but ultimately the user is responsible for data changes. Remember REDCap always keeps a log of changes.

  - subtitle: DB Object Modifications
    desc: One of the core internal motivations for RosyREDCap development was to have REDCap-project-agnositic functions that perform key transformations such as deidentify, derive fields, and transform (merge). However, these functions might not be utilized by the average user.

      - clean_DB
      - deidentify_DB
      - filter_DB
      - add_default_forms_transformation
      - add_DB_subset
      - add_field_transformation
      - transform_DB
      - untransform_DB
  - subtitle: DB Object Outputs
    desc: Mirror your DB object to a local/cloud file system. If you have subsets, will only update file if record beloning to that subset was updated.
